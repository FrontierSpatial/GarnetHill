{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "name": "Shuttle Stop", "icon": "Shuttle Stop", "description": "<p>The Huyck Preserve&rsquo;s Lincoln Pond Cottage, sitting on the shore of Lincoln Pond, was part of the Lincoln family homestead. Records show the Lincolns settled here before 1786. From the 1800s through the 1860s, the Lincolns and John and Harvey Bouton ran a sawmill just to the east of Lincoln Pond Cottage, harnessing the power of the original spillway off the pond. The early dam for that spillway was built in 1800. Myron Bryant was the last Lincoln Pond miller after returning from the California gold rush around 1849. The mill closed a few years before World War I, and the building collapsed shortly after. In 1912 the land around the pond was bought by Edmund Niles Huyck.</p><p>One barn associated with the Lincoln homestead became the Huyck Preserve&rsquo;s first research laboratory and was the site of important early research by naturalists and ecologists. Another barn, located across the street in the area of the larger parking lot, was the site of the discovery of bat echolocation by Donald Griffin, Ph.D. in 1939. In 1996 the barn near Lincoln Pond was transformed into the research center that you see today, with the old hand-hewn beams of the barn still visible in the basement.</p>", "url_1": null, "url_1_button_label": null, "url_2": null, "url_2_button_label": null, "photo1_filename": "Lincoln_Pond_Cottage_Current.jpg", "photo2_filename": "E_Odum_preparing_fish_scale_mounts.jpg", "audio_filename": "Lincoln_Pond.mp3" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -74.15825917, 42.52652962 ] } },
